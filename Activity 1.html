             <h2>About Cats</h2><br>
             <p>Cats are curious and independent animals known for their playful behavior, graceful movements, and affectionate nature. They have been beloved companions to humans for thousands of years, admired for their ability to hunt pests and their soft, soothing purrs. Cats are highly adaptable and can live comfortably in both small apartments and open countryside. Each cat has a unique personality—some are outgoing and social, while others are quiet and reserved. Whether curling up on a windowsill or chasing a toy mouse, cats bring joy and warmth to the lives of those who care for them.</p><br>

             <h2>Facts About Cats</h2><br>
             <p>Sure! Here are some fun and fascinating facts about cats:<br>

                1.🐱 Whiskers are like radar: Cats use their whiskers to detect objects and measure gaps—they’re so sensitive they can even pick up tiny changes in air currents.<br>
                
                2.😼 They sleep... a LOT: Cats can sleep 12–16 hours a day. Some even sleep up to 20 hours—basically, they're professional nappers.<br>
                
                3.😹 Purring isn't just for happiness: Cats purr when they're happy, but also when they’re scared, injured, or trying to comfort themselves or others.<br>
                
                4.🧼 Super clean: Cats spend up to 50% of their day grooming themselves. They’re basically neat freaks in fur coats.<br>
                
                5.😼 They can’t taste sweet things: Unlike humans, cats don’t have taste receptors for sweetness—so no, they won’t be impressed by your dessert.<br>
                
                6.🧠 Their brains are a lot like ours: A cat’s brain is about 90% similar to a human’s, especially the part that controls emotions.<br>
                
                7.🧗‍♀️ Built-in parkour pros: Cats can jump up to 6 times their body length in one leap, and their flexible spine helps them twist mid-air.<br>
                
                8.🐾 Each cat's nose is unique: Just like human fingerprints, no two cat nose prints are the same!<br>
